Exotic Industries tweaks to make metalworks useful and improve usability for Recipe Book / Factory planner.

To install: Download zip, drop in Factorio mods folder (%appdata%/Factorio/mods on Windows) and enable

Changes:
- Add module slots to metalworks (same as assembling machines)
- Remove duplicate metalworks recipes 
- Remove crushed iron plate / parts / beam recipes (bloat)

#### Safe to add to existing saves
Existing metalworks will automatically have their recipe changed to the equivalent assembling machine version.
